# trading-bot

AI-enhanced algorithmic trading bot for US equities. Trades **QQQ only** — buys TQQQ (3× bull) on BUY signals and SQQQ (3× bear) on SELL signals. Runs on a $2,000 Alpaca cash account with one trade per day.

> **Swing trading signals for retirement accounts** are handled by the separate [`swing_signal_engine/`](https://github.com/virtualsheng/swing-signal-engine) project.

## How it works

```
EOD Technical Signal (EMA/RSI/MACD/SMA) on QQQ
  ↓  stored in cache/daily_bias.json
Morning ORB Breakout (9:45 AM — if aligns with bias)

Ollama AI Setup Grader → confidence score + size multiplier
  ↓
Regime Detector (trending / ranging / volatile)
  ↓
Position entry: BUY TQQQ or BUY SQQQ
  ↓
Trailing stop (2%) ratchets up as price rises
  ↓
Exit: trail fires OR EOD close at 3:45 PM
```

## Strategy parameters

All parameters are set in `PARAMS` inside `runners/run_live_combined.py`:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `risk_pct` | `0.02` | 2% risk per trade = ~$40 on $2k |
| `max_positions` | `1` | One trade at a time |
| `max_position_pct` | `0.40` | 40% cap = ~$800 per position |
| `stop_mode` | `"or_low"` | Stop at Opening Range low |
| `stop_delay_minutes` | `15` | Stop inactive for first 15 min |
| `trail_stop_pct` | `0.02` | 2% trailing stop |
| `target_exit` | `False` | No hard target — trail + EOD exits |
| `reward_ratio` | `2.0` | 2:1 reference target |
| `ai_min_confidence` | `0.55` | Minimum AI confidence to enter |
| `min_stop_pct` | `0.005` | Floor stop (×3 = 1.5% for TQQQ/SQQQ) |
| `min_breakout_pct` | `0.001` | Must clear OR high by 0.1% |
| `eod_exit_time` | `"15:45"` | Force close TQQQ/SQQQ |
| `sleeptime_orb` | `"2M"` | 2-min iterations during ORB window |
| `sleeptime_default` | `"5M"` | 5-min iterations rest of day |

---

## Exit logic

No hard target exit. The trade rides until one of two things happens:

1. **Trailing stop fires** — stop ratchets up 2% below the highest price seen since entry. Catches genuine reversals while surviving normal TQQQ intrabar noise (~0.9–1.5%).
2. **EOD close at 3:45 PM** — TQQQ/SQQQ are always closed before end of day. No overnight holding of leveraged ETFs.

When price passes the initial target it logs: `TARGET PASSED TQQQ @ 34.56 | unrealised PnL: +$54.24 | trail=2.0% — letting it ride`

Fires on: trade entry, trade exit (with P&L), EOD signal summary.

| Channel | Variable |
|---|---|
| Email | `EMAIL_SENDER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_RECIPIENT` |
| Discord | `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| Telegram | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` |

## Dashboard

FastAPI server on port 5001. Run alongside the bot:

```bash
python runners/dashboard_server.py
# Open: http://localhost:5001
```

Tabs: **Overview** · **Positions** · **Trade Log** · **Performance** · **Regime**

---

## Backtest

```bash
python runners/run_backtest_combined.py
```

Configured for $2,000 starting capital, QQQ → TQQQ/SQQQ, Mar–May 2025 by default. Edit `START`, `END`, and `STARTING_CAPITAL` in the runner to change the period.

**2-year backtest results (May 2024 – May 2026):**
- Starting capital: $2,000 → ending ~$5,148
- Total return: +157% over 2 years (~79% annualized)
- Win rate: 67% (177/263 trades)
- Avg win / avg loss ratio: 2.78×
- Only 3 losing months out of 25

---

## Risk management

- Maximum 1 position at a time (QQQ only)
- 2% risk per trade (~$40 on $2,000)
- 40% maximum position size (~$800)
- Earnings within 48 hours: skip entry
- Stop inactive first 15 min after entry (stop-hunt protection)
- TQQQ/SQQQ always closed at 3:45 PM — no overnight holding
- One entry per day — re-entry blocked after stop or target passed

---

## AI layer

### Setup Grader
Before every entry, Ollama (`qwen3:8b`) grades the setup using the last 25 five-minute candles. Returns confidence 0.0–1.0 and a size multiplier. Entries below 0.55 confidence are skipped.

### Regime Detector
Every 30 minutes, classifies QQQ market regime: `trending_up`, `trending_down`, `ranging`, `volatile`, `mean_reversion`, `low_liquidity`. Adjusts stop/target distances and skips entries in unfavorable regimes.

### Trade Narrator
After a position closes, generates a 2–3 sentence journal entry stored in the SQLite trade journal.

---

## Known limitations

- **Python 3.12 only** — `numba` (required by LumiBot) does not support 3.13+
- **Cash account T+1 settlement** — funds available next morning after close
- **Ollama first-call latency** — qwen3:8b takes ~30–45s to load on cold start
